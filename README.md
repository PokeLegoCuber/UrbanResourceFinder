This project is based on [UrbanScout](https://github.com/Convenient-Coders/UrbanScout). 

UrbanResourceFinder is built from scratch and doesn't use any code found in the UrbanScout repository.

UrbanResourceFinder(URF) is a web application that provides locations to your nearest public necessities. At the moment these include water fountains, Wi-Fi hotspots, and recycling bins. More will be added in the future.
